# Object Detection Literature Survey

2020-2021 Fall CSE4084 - Multimedia Systems



This [report](https://github.com/mustafahakkoz/Object_Detection_Literature_Survey/blob/main/CSE4084_mustafa_hakkoz_FinalReport.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/mustafahakkoz/Object_Detection_Literature_Survey/blob/main/CSE4084_mustafa_hakkoz_Presentation.pptx) are prepared for the final project of CSE4084 Multimedia Systems course in Marmara University and aiming to cover foundational papers of object detection literature. Mainly classical approaches, deep learning detectors along with their design tricks are explained by using original papers and web blogs. 

Main accomplishments of this project are learning and examining the architectures, algorithms of design tricks / heuristics and gaining knowledge on state-of-art results. It can be pointed out that working this project was very helpful on introducing object detection domain and can be expanded in to video object detection, image segmentation, object tracking, 3D scenes and even more on autonomous driving domains as future work.
